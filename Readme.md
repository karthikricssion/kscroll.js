### Working on VanilaJS and CSS
Kscroll.js, a simple pureJS carousel using transform css properties to build. Reason for working on this carousel is to understand how mouse and touch event works together. And also there are lots of carousel out there that doesent provide with auto-width of items inside a carousel box. And Also need to follow there own set of rules


I have been working periodically you can always have a look at the [Status Demo](https://thirsty-keller-06d637.netlify.app/)

### TODO

- [ ] Work on different type of cards, just to showcase
- [ ] Create it as library, so that multiple carousel are possible
- [ ] work on display items too. As sometimes its needed
